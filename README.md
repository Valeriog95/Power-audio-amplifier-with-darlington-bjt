# Power-audio-amplifier-with-darlington-bjt

Hello everyone,
This repository shows a base amplifier made with only discrete components (without op-amp), it provides 25 watt  @ 8ohm.

I completed this project at 18 for my high school exam at ITIS Enrico Fermi institute in Rome and have made no changes since (relation remained in its original language). Later on, i created the board (using KiCad 5.0) and tested it using an electronic load and a signal generator/analyzer keithley2015.

Some features:

- More than 60% efficiency;
- THD less than 0.03% @ 1 watt;
- S/N > 85dB;


I'm open to any critiques/suggestions.

Hope that this simple project is helpful!
